# Highly autonomous Landmine Detection robot with Secure information transfer
## [Paper](https://github.com/priyankasrs/landmine_detection_robot-SASTRA/blob/master/Paper.pdf) published at *International Journal of Control Theory and Applications*

Many people lose their lives because of hidden landmines every day all round the world. The effect of landmine is so huge that it 
has a three-fold effect on humanity. The loss of limb or life has threatened so many people working in landmine prone areas.
Also the presence of landmines has deteriorated the lands which could in turn be used as a productive resource. Thus, such human factors and delayed sense of insecurity has affected many a countries in their path towards development.

Objective of designing this prototype is the **development of an autonomous robot which can detect and locate landmines accurately with the help of a GPS module and an automatic mail generation system** which would send the captured image of its present surroundings in a secured manner. A path planning algorithm based on uninformed search technique is also employed in the model for its motion and obstacle deflection. 

An **image encryption** algorithm using *IWT and Play-fair Cipher* is used for mail transfer. The technique of differential steer drive along with a GPS module helps in better localisation of the robot when compared to the previous prototype. A web based user interface (UI) application is developed which will help control the robot from a remotelocation. The major advantages of this prototype are its **cost effectiveness, dynamic and secured information transfer
